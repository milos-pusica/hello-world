Students with income and assets (movable and immovable) declared and/or owned abroad or in Italy and abroad by them and/or by their family, must request an equivalent indicator for the ISEE value for the "Right to Higher Education", called “EQUIVALENT ISEE”, through request to one of the following CAF offices that will automatically communicate this data to the University (the student must not bring nothing to the Registrar's Office and must not register the ISEE data through the Online Services).

Students who are already in Italy will have to attend, after making an appointment, to the CAF which provides this service with the following.

In accordance with the law the relevant paperwork must:

issued by the competent bodies of the state in which income was generated;
be legalised by Italian embassies or consulates abroad;
in addition to the above documents in foreign languages, faithful Italian translations of foreign language documents must be certified by competent embassies or consulates or by an official translator and attached to applications;
“household composition” abroad at the time the calculation application was presented;
the “income” over the previous calendar year of each member of the household. Where one or more members of the household, aged 18 or over, have earned nothing over the past calendar year it is compulsory to submit a declaration;
“buildings and land owned by the household” on 31st December of the previous calendar year with indications of its size in square metres (such documents must be issued by the relevant competent public body). Wherever the household unit has no buildings in its possession, a document to this effect must be submitted for each member of the household aged 18 or over;
“personal assets” owned on the 31st December of the previous calendar year by the household with indications on shares, dividends, equity holdings and shares of net assets of any companies owned.
Note: the availability of income and assets in Italy, their amount too, must be declared. Please note that without the student minimum income received in Italy, which is required by the ISEE regulations for independent status, the student must refer to their family’s income and assets. If these are abroad, the student must submit the EQUIVALENT ISEE.

Identity document:

valid identity card or passport with a photograph and personal data;
